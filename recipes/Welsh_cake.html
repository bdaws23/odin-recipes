   <h3> Description</h3>

   <p>This one is deff my fave even though I've never had it nor anything that resembles it. However this dish reminds me of my welshie and thus its paramount that it be on this list. Apparently it tastes really good but i'm just a Canadian so I can't really tell you more than that. Just by looking at the picture you can tell that its heaven to your tastebuds. However, as sexy as these sugary discs are, they'll forever remain the second sexiest thing to come from Wales.  </p>

   <p>You need more convincing do you bruv? Think you're to good for the pride of Wales innit? Just leave me alone and make this recipe and thank me later when you realize that I was right all along and you're just an ignorant, close-minded goon who is to timid to try his hand at a foreign delicacy of the highest caliber.</p>
