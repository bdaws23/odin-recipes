 <h3>Description</h3>
 <p>Well boys, is there anything quite so great as classic toast? Ya, I could put some crazy recipe with 4000 different ingredients. I could put something that requires hours to cook, but what would be the point. Anyone who has ever tried toast can attest to its tastiness. A truly delecable meal rivalled by none. Its beauty is in its simplicity really. All you need is some nice white bread and some butter or margarine and you're a minute away from paradise. </p>

 <p>Honestly, I could talk about toast all day, and probaby still fail to capture its magnficence. Look at the picture above, close your eyes, and imagine biting into that piece of toast. As your teeth sink in and you hear that satisying crunch. You feel that soft, fluffy bread hug your teeth, begging to be chewed and swallowed.</p>
